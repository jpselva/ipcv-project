# 3D tracking of facial features

## Objectives
Develop and test a method that is able to track the tip of the tongue and some facial landmarks
so as to find the 3D positions of these points. Using these facial landmarks, define a 3D reference coordinate
system that is attached to the face. Express the 3D position of the tongue tip in that coordinate system. Evaluate
the method.
